## 🧠 Core Philosophy

UKTourists is **not a booking site**.  
It is a **UK-centric travel knowledge graph** expressed as static pages.

LLMs are used to:
- cluster destinations by distance & cost
- surface cultural travel patterns
- localize language & context
- generate comparisons & rankings

Humans are required to:
- verify cultural accuracy
- validate pricing tiers
- approve distance logic
- avoid bias or caricature

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

UKTourists is built around **UK-origin-aware travel entities**.

### Core Entities
- Destination
- Country / Region
- Hotel / Resort
- Bar / Nightlife Venue
- Experience
- Travel Route (from UK)
- Price Tier
- Distance Band
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links by distance, price, and theme
- is programmatically generatable
